Notes for video 2:

# Intent
{
    Prior to video 2 being recorded the Text Editor currently
    has a StringBuilder that is being Append()'d to.

    The goal of video 2 is to introduce TextCharacters and
    add a button that applies Roslyn Syntax highlighting to the
    TextCharacters.
}

# Plan
{
    Do not go with 'TextCharacters' it is a confusing name.
    Instead go with 'RichCharacter' it is a more fitting name.

    # Step 1
        Create the class 'RichCharacter' in ClassLib/TextEditor

        public class RichCharacter
        {
            public char Value { get; init; }
            public byte DecorationByte { get; set; }
        }

    # Step 2
        Modify TextEditorBase class to maintain
        a public List<RichCharacter> Content { get; } = new();

        When the user types do Content.Add(event.Key);

    # Step 3
       When rendering the TextEditorBase.Content to the User Interface 
            @foreach() over all the RichCharacters and group
            contiguous RichCharacters with the same DecorationByte
            under a single span.
    
    # Step 4
        Add a button to the UserInterface that passes to Roslyn
        the new string (TextEditor.Contents.Select(x => x.Value).ToArray())

    # Step 5
        Write a GeneralSyntaxCollector (CSharpSyntaxWalker)
        to collect all the various syntax.

    # Step 6 
        Using the GeneralSyntaxCollector get the RichCharacters
        at the specified Span from the syntax and apply a corresponding
        DecorationByte.

    # Step 7
        Use DecorationByteHelper static class to convert from byte
        to css class.

    # Step 8
        Add .css file with the corresponding css classes 
        for the syntax and their styles.

Do not recap last episode. 
Instead say there is a link in the description of the youtube video.
This is because anyone who did watch the previous episode might click off
    from boredom as they already know what happened.
