Notes for video 7:

# Intent
{
    The goals of video 7 are:
		-Move the code to a Photino host.
		-Add notification system
		-Add loading of File from FileSystem into the TextEditor
	
	Goals that possibly need to wait until video 4:
		-Modify a loaded in file
		-Save the modification to the FileSystem
		-Notify the user
			-When the file is saved successfully
			-When the file is NOT successfully saved
}

# Plan
{
    # Step 1
        Clone Photino.Blazor from:
			'https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Blazor'
	
	# Step 2
        Create a new C# Project that replicates the 'Hello World'
		sample that Photino provides.
	
	# Step 3
		Have the new C# Project (the Photino host) reference the
		RazorClassLibrary.
		
	# Step 4
		-Add <BlazorTextEditor.RazorLib.BlazorTextEditorRazorLibInitializer />
			to the MainLayout.razor of the Photino host.
		-Register AddBlazorTextEditorRazorLibServices() in main
	
	# Step 5
		Take the code from Index.razor and put it in the Photino application.
		(in otherwords render the TextEditors again)
		
	# Step 6	
		-Create NotificationStates as a [FeatureState]
		-NotificationStates is a record with position property of
			ImmutableList<NotificationRecord> Notifications
		-Create the record NotificationRecord which has position properties:
			-NotificationKey
			-Title
			-RendererType
			-Parameters
			-AutomaticDisposalTimeSpan = null
		-Create actions:
			-RegisterNotificationAction
			-DisposeNotificationAction
		-Reducer add / remove to [FeatureState]
				
	# Step 7
		-Create in the ClassLib:
			-IDefaultErrorRenderer.cs
			-IDefaultInformationRenderer.cs
		-Register implementations in the RazorLib Services
		
	# Step 8
		-In RazorLib make
			-DefaultErrorRenderer component
			-DefaultInformationRenderer component
			-NotificationDisplay
			-NotificationsInitializer
		-In NotificationsInitializer ensure the foreach loop
			uses an @key when rendering the NotificationDisplay(s)
		-In the NotificationDisplay component ensure if the
			AutomaticDisposalTimeSpan  is not null that a Task.Run()
			is started to await Delay and then Dismiss();
			
	# Step 9
		-In RazorLib make
			-DefaultErrorRenderer component
			-DefaultInformationRenderer component
			-NotificationDisplay
			-NotificationsInitializer
		-In NotificationsInitializer ensure the foreach loop
			uses an @key when rendering the NotificationDisplay(s)
		-In the NotificationDisplay component ensure if the
			AutomaticDisposalTimeSpan  is not null that a Task.Run()
			is started to await Delay and then Dismiss();
			
	# Step 10
		-Use (not sure exact method name) File.ReadTextAsync()
			to read in a file's contents and display it in the
			Text Editor
		-Fluxor FileSystemCase
			-WriteToFileSystemAction
			-FileSystemStateEffects
